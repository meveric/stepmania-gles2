Congrats, you're reading the readme

-= Themekit piu: a base for piu themes =-
Use this theme as fallback for your own themes so you don't need to deal with
piu related metric setups like lifebars, tiers, effects and such; also some
screens are already linked (no attract screens tough)

-= Why you do this? =-
Well, I'm a PIU player, and as one, I like to have PIU setups in my Stepmania themes

-= Basics and how to =-
Easy!
º Put this under /Themes
º Make a blank folder under /Themes with whatever name you want for your theme
º Create a blank Metrics.ini file inside
º Open it
º Write in:

<code>
[Global]
FallbackTheme=_themekit_piu
</code>

º And there you go! just mount the screens that you want to work with or
add/replace metrics/elements

-= FAQ and details =-
Q: Can't select themekit
A: Themekits aren't supposed to be selectable, but if you want to use this as a
theme (wich actually works like one) remove the first underscore in the theme
folder name; alternately you can make a blank theme and fallback it with this
(explained up there^) and it should work as is.

Q: Theme doesn't work.
A: Maybe you're using stepmania 4 alpha or some old cvs build, use sm-ssc

Q: I want to use (partial or entirely) the lua modules outside
A: Go ahead, just please read the notes if there are any.

Q: Help me with X
A: Sorry, I don't feel like doing so...

Q: I want to contact you
A: I don't like to have my email address floating around, visit sm-ssc irc channel
at irc.badnik.net/sm-ssc, I'll be usually there

Q: Er... Your real name?
A: yeah, Alberto Ramos

-= Least but not least: Final notes =-
Well, I think that's pretty much it and what you need to know about this themekit,
I hope that you enjoy it, whenever you are or not a themer, and if you are one I
just hope that I didn't wasted time doing this... er... you found this useful ^^
