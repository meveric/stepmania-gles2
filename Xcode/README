REQUIREMENTS
Mac OS X 10.5 or higher is required. The Mac OS X 10.3.9 SDK needs to be
installed.

Xcode 3.0 or higher is required to build. Even though the stepmania project
appears to be a ProjectBuilder project, it has been updated by XCode and
no longer works with ProjectBuilder.

BUILD
1. Download StepMania from sourceforge.
2. Build StepMania by running:
$ xcodebuild -target stepmania -configuration Native
in the PBProject directory.
To build a universal binary instead, use "-configuration Universal"
instead of "-configuration Native"
3. (Optional) Run:
$ strip -x StepMania.app/Contents/MacOS/StepMania
to reduce the size of the binary.
