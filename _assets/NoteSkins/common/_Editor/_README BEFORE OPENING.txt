These are the original PSD Photoshop CS5 files for the Editor noteskin.
Normaly I dont make Readme's but for this one I make an exception for a reason.
The Center Tap Note, Down Tap Note, and DownLeft Tap Note, are GIANT files.
Which results in them taking up a load of mem when opened.
I have a Q6600 cpu, and 8gig memory, And it even lags for me.
So if you do open them please watch out because they will take a load of your cpu and memory.

Also I'm putting these files under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/ .
So I dont get that JEWISH DANCE GAME drama and others.
