This folder contains all graphics and fonts used in SMMAX2.0 theme project.
Project is aimed to cration of new version of very popular SM3.9`s SMMAX theme for use in SM5.0. 
It`s not intended to be a port! Project was desingned to be new from scratch.
I was planning to do all work myself but I hit the wall of my poor coding skills. 
So, after couple months lack of progress I`ve made a decision to share the project with community.
Main project file is "SMMAX20 screens project ver1_1.cdr". To open it you need Corel Draw X5 or later.
From corel you can export every tiny element to PNG or PSD whith transperacy. 
It`s just a matter of proper selection. 
Keep in mind that project graphisc was designed in 1920x1200 resolution. 
It is native resolution of my monitor. So now you must bear with me, 
because it`s lots of work to change it back to 1080p
Project use 2 fonts and you can find`em (or info about how to obtain it) in fonts folder.
Project is released under MIT License. Same as whole stepmania.
Thankyou for your attention, intrest, future contribution,
and please, really please, (I`m beging now) do not convert my work to something ugly. ^__^;
